# Pi Workflows product contract

Pi Workflows turns an agent-authored `steps.yaml` graph into repeatable work:
the same declared nodes, dependencies, routes, gates, budgets, and approval
boundaries execute in the same order while model output remains honestly
probabilistic.

## Users

- A coding agent creates, validates, runs, inspects, and improves a workflow.
- An operator understands the graph, configuration, live state, artifacts,
  cost, and failure without reading implementation code.
- Agent X can invoke one workflow during a task or schedule it as a durable
  automation through Loops.

## Product surfaces

1. `steps.yaml` — portable authored contract.
2. `piw` — stable human and machine-readable CLI. Every inspection command has
   `--json`; failures use non-zero exit codes and actionable errors.
3. Pi package — a native Pi tool and skill, installable from a local path or Git.
4. Codex and Claude Code skills — one shared `SKILL.md`, discovered from their
   documented user skill locations.
5. Loops adapter — beautiful graph/configuration display, live events, run
   inspection, and durable schedules. Loops owns scheduling; Pi Workflows owns
   workflow semantics.

## Definition of excellent

- A fresh install can create, validate, run, inspect, and schedule a workflow.
- Concurrent runs have isolated inputs and event streams.
- Static validation catches malformed DAGs, impossible routes, output-contract
  mismatches, unsafe missing gates, and invalid model/tool configuration before
  a paid call.
- Run evidence includes per-node state, attempts, resolved input, output,
  verifier result, tokens, cost, time, cache behavior, and final QA.
- Agents receive the smallest useful command/tool result and can branch on
  structured status instead of parsing decorative prose.
- The graph UI makes agent configuration legible: runtime kind, model,
  reasoning, tools, dependencies, route, retries, timeout, output contract,
  gate, judge, artifacts, and latest result.
- Automations are workflows plus an explicit trigger, stop policy, workspace,
  timeout, and recent-run evidence—not a second execution engine.

## Non-goals

- Pretending model generations are deterministic.
- Replacing ordinary scripts for tasks that do not benefit from a graph.
- Letting the visual editor become a second source of workflow truth.
- Requiring Agent X, Loops, Codex, or Claude Code for core execution.
