# Examples

This catalog progresses from two deterministic shell nodes to parallel Pi
agents, typed routing, tool allowlists, bounded judge loops, independent QA,
cache evidence, and optimization analysis. Every directory contains a complete
`steps.yaml` and a small `input.txt`; copy either one and edit it.

```

This graph is the materialized result of `parallel-review` followed by
`extract-action-items`. The checked-in YAML contains no action indirection, so
the Studio, validator, runner, cache, and evidence ledger use the same nodes.

All model-backed example nodes—including judges and QA—are pinned to
`openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` at `medium` reasoning for the public live suite.
That is a cost-conscious demonstration route, not a claim that same-model QA is
independent model-diversity evidence.

## Run one

```bash
piw validate examples/workflows/05-luna-summary/steps.yaml
piw run examples/workflows/05-luna-summary/steps.yaml \
  --input-file examples/workflows/05-luna-summary/input.txt
piw detail examples/workflows/05-luna-summary/steps.yaml --io
piw stats examples/workflows/05-luna-summary/steps.yaml
```

`detail` exposes resolved input, output, attempts, rejected judge candidates,
QA, tokens, cost, and time. `stats` sorts nodes by cost so the first row is the
next optimization candidate.

## Certify the catalog

The validation pass makes no model calls:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_example_suite.py --validate-only
```

The live pass runs all 13 examples once and runs the cache example twice. The
1,000-item scale path has its own free bulk command above:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_example_suite.py
```

Evidence lands under `examples/.artifacts/` and is intentionally gitignored.
Open `report.md` for the summary and optimization findings. Every row links to
the underlying `log.md` and `ledger.json`; each copied workflow retains its run
artifacts, rejected attempts, QA report, and git history.

The accepted v0.1.1 measurements and the observability defect they exposed are
documented in [`docs/example-certification.md`](../docs/example-certification.md).

## Advanced factory blueprints

The JSON files at the root of this directory are inputs and fixtures for the
opt-in production workflow factory. They demonstrate digest-bound approvals,
conditional graphs, replay corpora, bounded peer collaboration, and the
specialized product-planning harness. Start with the runnable YAML workflows;
use the factory only when the heavier guarantees are actually required.
